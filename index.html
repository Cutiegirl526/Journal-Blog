			  	<h4><b>Why I took this class</b></h4>

			  	<p>
			  		I took this class so that I can expand my knowledge in coding. I am planing to be in the computer engineering field and hopefully work here for live action. I learned a bit of coding from LiveAction and they gave me a website where I can practice coding and learn different types or "language" in coding.

				<h4><b>What I expect</b></h4>

				<p>
					I expect this class to be hard. Though I also expect this class to be fun and be entertaining. I know that there will be high standards and I also know that I will struggle here and there but times, I'll understand it if I practice.

	  			<h4>How I Structured A Web Applicatioon in HTML</h4>

	  			<p>
	  				Using the HTML structure, I was able to create a site. I also learned that I can place certain items into a "container" thus creating boxes around the texts I want and how to section it off.
	  			</p>

	  			<p>
	  				I love the fact that I'm learning so much but it is hard to grasp around because then I don't know I'm learning things until I take the time to look at what I'm working with and I actually know what I am doing.
