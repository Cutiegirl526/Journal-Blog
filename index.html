			  	<h4>Why I took this class</h4>

			  	<p>
			  		I took this class so that I can expand my knowledge in coding. I am planing to be in the computer engineering field and hopefully work here for live action. I learned a bit of coding from LiveAction and they gave me a website where I can practice coding and learn different types or "language" in coding.

				<h4>What I expect</h4>

				<p>
					I expect this class to be hard. Though I also expect this class to be fun and be entertaining. I know that there will be high standards and I also know that I will struggle here and there but times, I'll understand it if I practice.
