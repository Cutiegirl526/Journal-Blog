			  	<h4><b>Why I took this class</b></h4>
			  		<p>
			  		I took this class so that I can expand my knowledge in coding. I am planing to be in the computer engineering field and hopefully work here for live action. I learned a bit of coding from LiveAction and they gave me a website where I can practice coding and learn different types or "language" in coding.

				<h4><b>What I expect</b></h4>

				<p>
					I expect this class to be hard. Though I also expect this class to be fun and be entertaining. I know that there will be high standards and I also know that I will struggle here and there but times, I'll understand it if I practice. I also believe that we have high expectations to do because we have many projects to fill out on our own and we also have to represnt our school since it is the first year we are actually doing this class as an elective.

	  			<h4>How I Structured A Web Applicatioon in HTML</h4>

	  			<p>
	  				Using the HTML structure, I was able to create a site. I also learned that I can place certain items into a "container" thus creating boxes around the texts I want and how to section it off. To look at our websites, we actually use python version in which it is similar to the terminal but connects us to the site and we ca0n look at it and always change our site if anything. Although I have to be aware of the structure and to be sure I closed everything off, it is a very "cautious" thing to do becasue if I miss one step then it will be hard to find.
	  			</p>

	  			<p>
	  				I love the fact that I'm learning so much but it is hard to grasp around because then I don't know I'm learning things until I take the time to look at what I'm working with and I actually know what I am doing. It goes by too fast and there isn't much I can grasp onto in that moment and not be able to help anyone but when I am alone doing it with another class or following along on a websit, I know how to do it because of the things I learn and get taught.
